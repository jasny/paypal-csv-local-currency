# paypal-csv-local-currency

Convert foreign currencies in a [PayPal](http://paypal.com) CSV export to your local currency.

Conversion is done with the help of [fixer.io](http://fixer.io/). Conversion rates of PayPal are ignored.
This means the amounts will not exactly match those on your bankaccount/creditcard. It's recommended to book
the difference as currency exchange costs.

This is an all in one HTML/JavaScript solution. You can simply download and use it without worrying about
installation or you can use it online:

_Note: Currently only the Dutch export is supported. English can be
[added upon request](https://github.com/jasny/paypal-csv-local-currency/issues). For other languages, please
